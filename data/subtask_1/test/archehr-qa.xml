my 59 year old fiance was in Intensive care for 2 weeks. He suddenly developed septicemia which highlighted a faulty valve from birth. He had surgery to replace valve 3 weeks ago and then had to have it perfomed again last week because the infection attacked the new valve. As well as all this the abscess broke off and scattered over his brain causing multiple mini strokes. He is improving slowly. We were due to fly to the Maldives to stay on a remote island, if he lucky enough to recover by then do you think this is a good idea? Many thanks

Hello,My doctor said I had pneumocystis carinii but didnt know anything about it......I was hospitalized in ICU for one week. I have lived with ankylosing spondylitus, Crohns and pneumonia in the past. I have lived with difficulty in breathing and cough. I also found out near the end of my stay b12 was high so I had to retest. I have been losing strength alot that I fell bedridden. I am really not one who likes hospitals. I have lost alot of trust here in this area, it is just the way it has become here.... THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

my brother spend 8 days in intensive care with an infection which brought his b/p dangerously low. He had kidney stones which they pushed back into kidney. He had had the pain which has been different from the pain of stones which he has continuously had all of his life. They are now telling him he has an enlarged spleen and kidney. He is scheduled Tuesday to have a stint removed and another one inserted. Could this be cancer? He had just had stones blasted from the other kidney two weeks before the infection which put him in intensive care.

Hello. My mom age 84 is in the hospital due to a fall. Thank God nothing is broken however she doesn t recognize most of us and talks to our deceased loved ones. She actually gets upset when we don t acknowledge that they are there. She has been off of all pain meds for three days so that was ruled out. Her heart rate jumped from 150 down to 50 and she was in the cardiac care unit of the hospital that she was taken to. She seems to be failing. She is a diabetic, controlled b/p and basically a healthy person. She suffers from depression since my dad passed 10 yrs ago. Do you think there is a chance of her getting her memory back? Thank you.

I have side effects from 2 medicines that I am taking. They are for high blood pressure. I have taken them for about a year and 3 months. I believe I am toxic to these medicines at this point and I am worried about taking them. What is the best way to taper the medicines? This happened once before and I ended up in the intensive care for 7 days due to the medicines. I also had elevated potassium and was in critical condition for a short time. The heart problem was not present any longer and I had been taking the medicines for several years. No one knew why the heart was not a problem any longer. Some doctors thought that I had a virus. I have a cardiologist but he can not tell what is wrong with my heart. What would you recommend? I think I am in more danger from the medications at this point than from the heart

I am a 34 year old male. I had fever and headache that would not go away. I also had dizziness about 10 days after the headache started. My primary doctor suggested I may need to go to the ER. The next morning on Saturday I felt worse so I headed to the ER. They admitted me and after a few days in the neuro ICU and a round of every test they could run, the final diagnosis was (or it seemed like their best guess) was viral meningitis. I ve now been home from the hospital for three weeks and still do not feel well. Additionally, I have seen a neuro-opthalmologist specialist that agrees with the diagnosis. She reviewed the results of the lumbar puncture as well as conducted a round of tests, and she did not find any permanent damage and believes the dizziness is post-viral. I still have headaches and feel like I am slightly dizzy and like I am in a bit of a fog. My neurologist says to rest, drink plenty of fluids and be patient; however, I am very depressed and worried that I am never going to feel well again. Also, the opthalmologist says it is normal for this to take up to several months to go away. Additionally, the neurologist says you are fortunate that you did not suffer a stroke, seizures, memory loss...and that you are walking and talking . While I am greatful that I did not suffer those things, I have not worked in 5 weeks and have no quality of life. The feeling of being in a fog is worse than the headaches. As soon as I get up and start moving around, I feel strange and feel like I should sit down. I am eating and drinking the fluids as the doctor suggested and resting all the time. Because I m not getting any real clear answers from the doctor, I have spent a lot of time reading articles on the Internet and I am very scared now. Most documentation out there says I should have been better in 7-10 days with Viral Meningitis; however, there are numerous stories of people that say their lives have never been the same and they were sick for months (some years)! At this point I don t know what to do. If I go to another Neurologist for a second opinion, I am pretty sure that my insurance will not cover an additional round of the same tests. The current Neurologist is at a loss other than doing a 3rd MRI - and the insurance company has not yet authorized.

Hello, my friend's wife is in ICU after having a seizure. Her psychiatrist had recently increased her dose of Nardil from 30 mg to 60 mg per day. She also had been sedated for 2 days. Since being discontinued from the sedative she is now 2 days without any drugs but, she seems very delirious, disorientated and confused about why she is in the hospital. She also seems to be very agitated. The nurse just told my friend his wife is hallusinating now. In your professional opinion was the weaning period long enough or is she suffering totally from Nardil withdrawal? Could she be septic or have developed a Meningitis? Should we all be freaking out, or not.

I ve been experiencing bouts of severe abdominal pain over the past 2 years and admitted to the hospital four times. I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , GERD , ileitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an CXR, a KUD scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 82 year old female. I currently take omeprazole cd 40mg, atenolol 100mg, ferrous sulfate 300 daily, and dicyclomine 10mg four times a day. I had H Pylori a while back, had my gall bladder removed, had tubal ligation. I also had benign hyperplasticity polyp. My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, tearing abdominal pain, tightness in my chest, headaches. The CT showed a hiatal hernia and a mass was sent out for a biopsy. The ct scan showed typhlitis , whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed ventral hernia. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is. Here are the majority of the pieces of the puzzle, any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated.
